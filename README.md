# üöÄ This is my portfolio webpage üöÄ

This app is a showcase for all the projects that I have been working on. It also
contains all additionaly skills that I know prior to Web development. The
webpage has an experience timeline to showcase what I was doing before.

Logo / Icons are designed in Illustrator as SVG and change the fill to
"currentColor" to allow dark mode switching.
